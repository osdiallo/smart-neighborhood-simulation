Epic: Neighborhood Simulation
Language: Python

User Story: As a user, I want to be able to change the time step of
	my simulation without changing its run time so that I can efficiently
	run different length simulations

User Story: As a user, I want each house in the neighborhood to regularly
	report information about temperature and energy usage at each timestep
	so that I can make sure the information is being logged properly

User Story: As a user, I want to specify how many houses are in my
	neighborhood without having to specify the exact parameters of
	each house so that I can quickly and easily set up different
	simulations of my neighborhood

User Story: As a user, I want to calculate the inside temperature and
	electrical load of a house over the course of a specified time period
	so that I can realistically simulate the operations of a real neighborhood

User Story: As a user, I want to easily save the state of my simulation
	at each time step so that I can resume interrupted simulations without
	having to completely start over

User Story: As a user, I want my simulations to keep a historical log of
	each house’s information at each time step so that I can easily see how
	a house’s information changes over time

User Story: As a user, I want each house in my neighborhood to run asynchronously
	so that the analysis and events of one house do not affect another

User Story: As a user, I want to be able to view a graphical representation of
	the artificial neighborhood

User Story: As a user, I want this program and its features to be extensible so
	that it can be used in and for other applications than the one it was 
	originally developed for

User Story: As a user, I want to be able to easily interact with a graphical
	interface to adjust and run my simulations
